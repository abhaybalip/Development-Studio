Dependency management in Spring Boot using Gradle is essential for maintaining consistent versions of libraries and frameworks throughout your application.
Spring Boot simplifies this process by offering several methods to manage dependencies effectively.

## Key Approaches to Dependency Management

### 1. Spring Dependency Management Plugin

The **Spring Dependency Management Plugin** allows you to manage dependencies in a way that is similar to Maven, making it easier for developers familiar with Maven to transition to Gradle. This plugin enables property-based customization of managed versions and allows the import of BOMs (Bill of Materials) to define dependency versions centrally.

#### Example Configuration

To use the Spring Dependency Management Plugin, include it in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.1.5.RELEASE'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.8.RELEASE'
}

dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:2.1.5.RELEASE'
    }
}
```

This setup allows you to declare dependencies without specifying their versions, as they will be managed by the imported BOM.
